      <p>Phoenix Perry creates physical games and user experiences. A consummate advocate for women in game development, she founded Code Liberation Foundation. This organization teaches women to program games for free. Since starting in 2012, this project has reached over 1000 women in the New York area between the ages of 16 to 60. Fostering professional growth and mentoring new leaders in the field, she strives to infuse the industry with new voices. As principal founder in Dozen Eyes Games, a company producing works for social change and interactive installations, she also is an entrepreneur. She is a Lecturer at Goldsmiths in Physical Computing and Games.</p>

<p>Her speaking engagements include GDC, Games for Change, The Open Hardware Summit, Indiecade, Comic Con, Internet Week, Create Tech, IBM Dev Pulse, Montreal International Games Summit and NYU Game Center among others. Perry’s creative work spans a large range of disciplines including drawing, generative art, video, games, interfaces and sound. Her projects have been seen worldwide at venues and festivals including the GDC, E3, Come out and Play, Maker Faire at the New York Hall of Science, Lincoln Center, Transmediale, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, LAMCA, Harvest Works, Babycastles, European Media Arts Festival, GenArt, Seoul Film Festival and Harvestworks. In 2011 she co-authored the book, Meet the Kinect with Sean Kean and Johnathan Hall. Finally, she has curated since 1996 in a range of cultural venues, the most recent of which is her own gallery, Devotion Gallery until 2014. Devotion was a Williamsburg gallery focused on the intersection of art, science, new media, and design.</p>

      <p>Catt is a product designer, game maker, and developer.</p>

<p>With a design career spanning over ten years, she has done design work for companies of all sizes including SoundCloud, Bedrocket, and Nasdaq. She started coding at the age of 10, designing at the age of 15, and graduated from SVA with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2011. In 2016, she received an MS in Integrated Digital Media from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.</p>

<p>An observer at heart, Catt focuses on ways to improve the lives of people through design. She is interested in ways to increase empathy through interactive media. Many of her personal projects center around the human experience and tackle issues related to interpersonal relationships, self-expression, gender, and race.</p>

<p>In addition to her product design work, Catt makes video games by herself and with friends. She is one-third of Brooklyn Gamery, a Brooklyn-based game development studio that also organizes diversity-focused game jams and events. In her spare time, she mentors women and teaches game development through The Code Liberation Foundation. She sometimes draws comics.</p>

<p>Catt’s work has been covered by many publications including BuzzFeed, Black Enterprise, and The Mary Sue. She has spoken at schools and events across the country, including a TEDx event.

      <p>Asia is a Product Designer fueled by curiosity, compassion, and all things geeky. She loves solving problems at the intersection of tech, art, business, community, education, and publishing. When she was introduced to the web in 2001, she created a blog and art gallery, discovering her calling. The web affords her an infinite canvas, as challenging as it is rewarding. An avid gamer since childhood, Asia joined Code Liberation to help make games a more accessible creative outlet to all. She is eager to put her talents as a designer, teacher, writer, and illustrator to use to ship ideas that bring people closer together and change the world.</p>
