Do you like making games?
Do you want to make games in 3D?
Did you answer yes to all of the above, but have no clue where to start?

Come join us on November 20th through November 23rd at MAGNET for our first Unity Boot Camp. What is Unity you ask? It is an extremely powerful 3D Game Engine [available for free](http://unity3d.com/unity/download)! From the interface to working in 3D space to making your own game, this boot camp will cover everything you will ever need to know to learn how to use Unity and make outstanding games without needing to pay an exorbitant amount of money.
