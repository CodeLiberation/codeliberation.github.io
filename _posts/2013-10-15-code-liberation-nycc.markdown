If you guys didn’t know already, our very own Phoenix Perry was asked to speak at NYCC this last weekend along side Doug Wilson, Naomi Clark, Syed Salahuddin, and Zach Gage. The focus was on the NYC Game Design Underground. Raising up good points, this panel made attendees aware of the lack of monetary support the game scene in our fair city is missing. That and the irony that for being known as the City that never sleeps, NYC game designers just don’t have the time.

But it seems the general take away of this panel is that aside from monetary support, emotional support for struggling developers is invaluable. We’re a community for a reason, so don’t forget to support each other, even if its just encouraging words!
