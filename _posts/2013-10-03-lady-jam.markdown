Last weekend, The Code Liberation Foundation held its first ever Lady Jam, a Game Jam made solely for women and those who identify as women. The event kicked off on Wednesday with an OpenFrameworks workshop run by our very own Jane Friedhoff and Nina Freeman. What started off with a workshop with superb baking analogies in C++, ended with four phenomenal games.

Participants came from various backgrounds of coding experience and all left with new knowledge on OpenFrameworks and their very own, working games. The Code Liberation Foundation would like to congratulate all the participants on a job well down and thank everyone who came out for our first ever Lady Jam. We’d also like to thank NYU-Poly for helping us host this Game Jam and providing us with the space at the Media and Games Network [MAGNET] for our participants to come up with their awesome ideas in an equally awesome space. It was more successful than we had hoped and we can’t wait for our next one!
