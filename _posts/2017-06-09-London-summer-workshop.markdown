We are very happy organize a second workshop series at the V&A this summer. In this 8 part free workshop series you will learn how to design and program games on the web. We will be exploring [p5.js](https://p5js.org), and will learn how to create your own physical buttons using the Arduino!

And the best part is, during the Digital Design weekend at the V&A in September you will get the opportunity to showcase your game.

For more information head over to the [V&A blog](http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/code-liberation-2) and subscribe yourself trough this [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/kzbQKTgfSphwG09F3).

The workshop series will run from July through September.
