This workshop features the creative work of [Libs Elliot](http://www.libselliott.com/) who will give a lecture about her process.

The lecture part of this event is open to all. The workshop session is for anyone who identifies as female.

Elizabeth (Libs) Elliott is a textile artist exploring the intersection of technology and traditional craft by using generative design to build handmade quilts. A deep appreciation for craftsmanship, design history and future-focused applications are all reflected in her work. She studied Material Art & Design at OCAD University and lives and works in Toronto, Canada. Her commissions include work for individuals and corporate clients such as Playground Inc. She has exhibited her projects internationally and been covered by press such as Gizmodo and The Creators Project.

Libs will discuss the path that led her to quilting with code, the process she goes through to build her quilts and why this unexpected combination just makes sense.

After her lecture, we will explore generative packing algorithms that let you fill a screen with shapes. These are handy for costume design, textiles, or game boards.

In a second upcoming workshop lead by Julia Detar, of Mushroom 11 fame, we will take our designs and make pillows, clothing and blankets.
