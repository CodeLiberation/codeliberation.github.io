We did a popup games exhibition, coordinated by Kiona Niehaus, with the BFI on June 16th, 2018 as part of their Women With a Movie Camera festival. The day was a day of activism and conversation at BFI Southbank went beyond the usual discourse about diversity in the film industry, calling for radical strategies to bring about structural change. We had a wonderful time showing off the games our members and friends have been working on so far this year as well as sharing conversations with women from a wide range of disciplines.
