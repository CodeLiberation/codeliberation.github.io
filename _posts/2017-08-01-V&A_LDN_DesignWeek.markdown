Code Liberation worked in collaboration with the Processing Foundation, the V&A, Machines Room and Goldsmiths to run a series of eight workshops that resulted in an exhibition of new games created during these workshops. For the workshop we also created teaching resources for p5.js which include slides and sample code anyone can use for free to teach p5js.

## K. Reid
Title: Lunar Alchemy

![Lundar Alchemy](/img/blog/2017-ldw/03.png)

You have very unwisely been bitten by a werewolf. Luckily you have your lab, alchemical components and a vague memory of medication that might hold the lunar urges at bay. Better get on that hadn’t you?

K Reid works in art and technology and is frequently the person making sure the thing goes or getting excited about excel sheets. They first played games when the NES was a hot commodity and has been a passionate fan of handheld systems ever since. Their main interest is in narrative and the narrative possibilities interaction opens up. They are also far too fond of second person point of view which is clearly the fault of too many text adventure games as a child.


## Laura Cugusi
Title: Partners in Crime

Every game is ultimately an interaction between individuals whereas the payoff for each player is affected by the decision of others. In game theory, the so called “prisoner’s dilemma” represents a conflict between doing what you think would be the best option for yourself, or choosing to consider others as well.
“Partners in crime” is nothing more than a simulation of the famous prisoner dilemma.
Play now with a stranger.

Laura Cugusi is an artist, researcher, photographer, filmmaker and writer.
After studies in media, sociology and political science, she has been involved in multiple research projects focusing on migration, borders, public space and their representation in the media.
She works with analogue and digital photography, video, drawing and sound.
She is always interested in learning new languages.


## Mandy Saunders
Title: Suck Up the Jam

![Suck Up The Jam](/img/blog/2017-ldw/06.png)

You are in charge of filling up vats of jam at the jam factory, but you have taken your eye off the ball and now blobs of jam are splattering everywhere! Use the controls on your awesome machine to suck up the jam before your supervisor sees the mess!

Mandy Saunders is a producer working for a games company in Woking, Surrey. Even though she is a pretty big coding n00b, she likes to make short, quirky games in her spare time and this is her second collaboration with Code Liberation. She also used to work in a jam factory. @cheekyyoyo


## Natasha Trotman
Traces

![Traces](/img/blog/2017-ldw/07.png)

Traces falls under the umbrella project Tangible Statistics Linguistics which explores the texture of neurodivergent experiences.  Traces has an ultimate aim of turning the notions of 'error' on its head. Each error enables the player to gain snippets of data; Enabling the player to learn more about neurodivergence with the resulting experience fostering empathy and awareness of the subject.

Natasha Trotman is an MA student in Information Experience Design graduate from the Royal College of Art, with a background in graphic design and computer science. Her practice includes human-computer interaction, craft, and working with data, exploring the voices within quantitative and qualitative data, and creating physical interactions through investigative play.

## Elvia Vasconcelos
Title: The Internet

![The Internet](/img/blog/2017-ldw/08.png)

‘The Internet’ is the band I’ve been listening to (rather obsessively) lately. Look them up.
The internet is the place where I spend most of my waking time.
The other day, my mate told me “I work on the internet”. #LOLZ
This ‘The Internet’ is about clicking, about infinite scrolling, about bleeding eyes, about always wanting more.  When are you going to stop?

Elvia Vasconcelos is a Designer, wannabe hacker, compulsive drawer and dressmaker. She enjoys torturing toasters and other domestic objects. Earlier this year Elvia tried to have a relationship with an Alexa and failed - look up ‘Alexa Diaries’.
Her work is guided by a desire to hold on to things but not exactly to hold them in place.

Special thanks to Mark Caswell-Daniels for his infinite patience.

## Rachel Clancy
Title: In Other Words || Images:
![In Other Words](/img/blog/2017-ldw/11.png)

Description:  In tattooing, it is not unusual for a client to have a particular word or phrase drawn in a language they do not speak, sometimes simply because they consider another alphabet or language system to be more beautiful. In Other Words presents four different graphic alphabets which allow users to generate their own designs by typing phrases into the text box. Each letter character has its own image, but the size and placement are set at random - so the same design will never appear twice.

More images will be shared on the project’s Instagram:

Rachel Clancy is a graphic designer, illustrator, and tattoo artist in training.

![Underwater](/img/blog/2017-ldw/12.png)
