Our very own Phoenix Perry will be speaking at CreateTech 2013 at the Brooklyn Bowl on October 3rd. CreateTech is a conference which aims at bringing speakers from different backgrounds in varying fields, such as art and technology, together to find out just how these seemingly polar opposites work to balance our culture, our marketing and our creativity. Phoenix will be giving a talk on game design and explain what goes into her creative process.

Online registration for the event has closed, but CreateTech has said on their website that those still wishing to attend can purchase a ticket onsite at the Brooklyn Bowl.
