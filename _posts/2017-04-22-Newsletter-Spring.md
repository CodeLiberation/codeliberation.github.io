A short and fun workshop by Code Liberation for women, non-binary and femme identifying people. In this workshop you will be introduced to p5.js to start creating games and interactive art on the web. We will explain the basic elements needed for a program, create a simple game together and give you information how to learn further. No prior knowledge needed about programming to join this workshop.   This workshop is supported by the Processing Foundation.

**Requirements: None, all welcome**

Tools participants should bring: Laptop computer with Processing (https://processing.org/download/) and p5.js Complete Library (https://p5js.org/download/) installed.

### Processing Foundation Collaboration 
![P5](/img/blog/2017-spring-news/p5.png)

Code Liberation is partnering with the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) to develop a new set of in person learning materials for [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) designed by Saskia Freeke. 


These materials are being developed in workshops at Games Festivals in Europe. Last month, our first workshop in this series was held at Now Play This at Somerset House. Our next workshop in this series will be at A Maze. 

We will release these materials this year and make them available for all educators to use in classrooms. They will include slides, teaching image resources and code.
