Hey there Indie developers! Jane Friedhoff and Phoenix Perry will be speaking at this years IndieCade in Los Angeles!

Make sure to stop by Jane’s Diversity Roundtable, where she’ll be leading a discussion on furthering diversity in the game industry by bringing in people from varying backgrounds in hopes of making the developer pool just as diverse as our world. And don’t forget to go to Phoenix’s panel “Increasing Diversity in Game Development”, where she’ll be talking about the Code Liberation Foundation and how she’s hoping for more gender equality in the game development community.

Also don’t forget to stop by and check out Jane’s game, [Hermit Crab’s in Space](http://goldenrubygames.com/games/hermit-crab-in-space), which just so happens to be a Finalist for IndieCade 2013! We wish her the best of luck this year!
