Catt is a product designer, game maker, and developer.

With a design career spanning over ten years, she has done design work for companies of all sizes including SoundCloud, Bedrocket, and Nasdaq. She started coding at the age of 10, designing at the age of 15, and graduated from SVA with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2011. In 2016, she received an MS in Integrated Digital Media from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.

An observer at heart, Catt focuses on ways to improve the lives of people through design. She is interested in ways to increase empathy through interactive media. Many of her personal projects center around the human experience and tackle issues related to interpersonal relationships, self-expression, gender, and race.

In addition to her product design work, Catt makes video games by herself and with friends. She is one-third of Brooklyn Gamery, a Brooklyn-based game development studio that also organizes diversity-focused game jams and events. In her spare time, she mentors women and teaches game development through The Code Liberation Foundation. She sometimes draws comics.

Cattâ€™s work has been covered by many publications including BuzzFeed, Black Enterprise, and The Mary Sue. She has spoken at schools and events across the country, including a TEDx event. You can follow her @cattsmall on Twitter and view her work at [www.cattsmall.com](http://www.cattsmall.com).
