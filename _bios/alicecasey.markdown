Alice helped to found the London branch of Code Liberation in 2016. She is currently studying Games Programming at Goldsmiths College, and is always looking for new programming challenges. She has been embracing games since she could pick up a controller, and continues to collect and play retro titles to this day. Alice wishes to help make the world of games a more inclusive space for LGBT people, and in turn use it to cast light on issues faced in the community through interactive experiences and storytelling. Alice enjoys public speaking, as well as helping others to realise their potential through co-operation. She spends her spare time building computers and catching up on the latest cartoons.
