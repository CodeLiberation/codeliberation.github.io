Caroline Sinders is an interaction designer for IBM Watson, artist, researcher and videogame designer. She was born in New Orleans and is currently based in Brooklyn (and occasionally lives in airports). She received her masters from New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program where she focused on HCI, prototyping, and interactive storytelling. She holds a bachelor of fine arts from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts in Photography and Imaging, where she studied digital culture and took portraits with a large format camera. Caroline’s background and current work is a manifestation of what she finds fascinating, which is people. She loves digital ethnography and five dollar words.
