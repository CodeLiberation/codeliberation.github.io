Kaira Villanueva started Code Liberation as a student, taking their introductory course to game programming with C++ in 2013, inspiring her to volunteer part-time, organizing events and teaching classes.  She enjoys reviewing new software by developing applications or games with them, and is always up for a debugging challenge. At the present time, she is studying computer science with a concentration in earth science at Columbia University, with the goal of engineering technology that can mitigate the effects of global warming on our planet.
